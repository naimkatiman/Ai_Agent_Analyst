<summary>Peek into the AI's brain... if you dare! 🕵️‍♂️</summary>

- `src/ai_web_app/main.py`: The maestro orchestrating our AI symphony
- `src/ai_web_app/crew_integration.py`: Where AI agents come to party
- `tests/`: A gladiatorial arena for our code to prove its worth

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

## 🧪 Running Tests

<details>
<summary>Watch our code do backflips! 🤸‍♂️</summary>

## 🎨 Customization

<details>
<summary>Make it yours! (No artistic skills required) 🎨</summary>

1. Tweak `config/config.yaml` to adjust the AI's coffee intake (aka parameters)
2. Add new AI agents in `crew_integration.py`. Maybe a joke-telling agent?
3. Expand `main.py` with more routes. The sky's the limit!
